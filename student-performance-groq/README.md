# Student Performance Intelligence

A professional Streamlit dashboard for analyzing student marks and attendance with **LangChain + Groq**. It accepts CSV and Excel files, calculates statistics locally, and uses short, controlled Groq calls to produce clear academic insights.

## Product overview

The dashboard is designed for a teacher or academic coordinator who needs a fast class snapshot:

- Upload a `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.json`, `.parquet`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` file.
- Preview cleaned and validated data before analysis.
- See class average, attendance, top performer, and students needing attention.
- Generate student-level evaluations and class comparisons.
- Read an executive class report with strengths and recommended interventions.
- Search all student outputs by name or roll number.
- Open the bell curve only when requested, choose a subject, and highlight a student on the class distribution.
- Download detailed analyzed data as CSV or Excel; there is no JSON download in the interface.

### Supported input layouts

```text
student, math, science, english, attendance
```

The Intake Agent understands common alternatives such as `Student Name`, `Name`, `Mathematics`, `Physics`, `Language`, `Present`, and `Attendance Rate`. It also detects sheets where metrics are arranged as rows and student names are arranged as columns. PDF and DOCX inputs must contain a real table. If a file contains no analyzable numeric performance fields, the app explains what is missing instead of silently producing a bad report. If attendance is not present, it keeps the dataset usable and clearly marks attendance as 100% rather than blocking the upload. Scores and attendance must be between 0 and 100.

## Multi-agent architecture

The interface presents seven focused stages so the user can see exactly what is happening. This keeps behavior predictable and controls token usage.

1. **Intake Agent** — understands headers, rows, columns, and data types locally.
2. **Calculation Engine** — computes grades, averages, ranks, and trends locally.
3. **Performance Agent** — batched Groq evaluation for levels, strengths, weaknesses, and actions.
4. **Benchmark Agent** — local gap calculation and priority assignment with zero Groq calls.
5. **Report Agent** — one compact Groq call for the class summary and interventions.
6. **Export layer** — prepares CSV and Excel downloads.

All arithmetic is local. The LLM receives compact records instead of the full spreadsheet on every call.

## Token controls

Configure strict output limits in `.env` or your deployment secrets. The website intentionally has **no API-key field and no Groq configuration controls**; credentials stay server-side.

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
SCHEMA_MAX_TOKENS=180
EVAL_MAX_TOKENS=420
EVAL_BATCH_SIZE=8
REPORT_MAX_TOKENS=220
```

The dashboard also limits prompt output length and requests JSON-only responses. Evaluation is batched, and benchmarking is deterministic/local. Total calls for `N` students are:

```text
1 schema call + ceil(N / EVAL_BATCH_SIZE) evaluation calls + 1 report call
```

For example, 30 students with a batch size of 8 use only 6 Groq calls instead of 62. The class comparison uses local arithmetic and consumes zero Groq tokens.

After a run, the dashboard shows an **Agent Activity Report** in order. Each stage explains what it did, how many records it processed, which columns it understood, what statistics it calculated, and what output it produced. The results include best performers, priority support learners, global name/roll-number search, and a click-to-open bell curve that keeps the full class distribution visible while highlighting a selected student.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-performance-intelligence.git
cd student-performance-intelligence
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # Windows: copy .env.example .env
# Add GROQ_API_KEY to .env
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local URL shown by Streamlit, usually `http://localhost:8501`.

## Streamlit Community Cloud deployment

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Create a new app at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io).
3. Select the repository and set the main file to `app.py`.
4. In **Advanced settings → Secrets**, add:

```toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_key"
GROQ_MODEL = "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
SCHEMA_MAX_TOKENS = "180"
EVAL_MAX_TOKENS = "420"
EVAL_BATCH_SIZE = "8"
REPORT_MAX_TOKENS = "220"
```

Never commit `.env` or API keys. `.gitignore` already excludes local secrets.

### Open it on a phone

After deployment, open the Streamlit app URL directly in your phone browser. The app is responsive: upload, pipeline cards, report cards, search, bell curve controls, and downloads stack vertically for narrow screens. For the best experience, use the latest Chrome or Safari and rotate to landscape only when viewing wide detailed tables.

## Privacy and responsible use

The app performs calculations locally, but compact student summaries are sent to Groq when analysis is run. Use student IDs or pseudonyms where appropriate, follow your institution's data policy, and obtain the required permission before uploading identifiable student records. The output is decision support and should be reviewed by a qualified teacher; it should not be the sole basis for an educational decision.
